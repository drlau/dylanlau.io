If you ever moved to another country before, I'm sure you're aware of how rough the process can be. Everyone has their own circumstances for moving to make the whole experience difficult, but here's mine.

# Background

First, a bit of background on me. My parents are both from Singapore and moved to Canada about a year or two before I was born. Since then, we have been in Canada for my entire life, except for 8 months when I was working in San Francisco for an internship. As a result, my international working experience is very limited, as working in the US as a Canadian is a relatively straightforward process.

Also, as a child, I was supposed to go to Chinese school and I would have learned Mandarin or Cantonese there. But as a child, I thought, "More school? No thank you.", as it would have been on a Saturday. Looking back, this is something I regret, as now I only know English. As for Japanese, I studied it for approximately a year while in University. I took 3 non-credit classes in the evenings, and in my final semester I took a credit class, which had plenty of overlap with the last non-credit class that I took. So, safe to say that my Japanese is incredibly limited, about survival level.

# Why Japan?

Prior to living in Japan, I traveled to Japan for vacation 8 times, each being about 1-3 weeks long. I loved everything about Japan - the food, culture, people, lifestyle, infrastructure, climate and more. Eventually at some point, my best friend would make jokes to me, asking "Why don't you just live there?".

When I went to Japan in March 2019, it was the first time I was traveling to Japan alone. My flight was via Chicago, so I had to go through US Customs first in Toronto. The customs officer asked where I was headed, which I responded "Japan". He then asked what was my occupation, which I responded "Software Engineer". He took one final look through my documents and handed them back to me and said, "Make sure you come back". For some time, I wondered, "What did he mean by that?", and a few months later in May I understood. As a Software Engineer, language barriers are much less significant than other occupations, so the places you can work are not as restricted as other professions. A career in Japan as a foreign Software Engineer is absolutely possible.

What made me think about this in the first place was the current state of my work in May 2019. At that point, I was working at Pivotal in Toronto for almost a year, but it left a bit to be desired. I enjoyed Pivotal as a company. The field of work was interesting, coworkers are great and general environment was great. I had some nitpicks about the work style that I will cover in a post in my tech blog, but it wasn't the deal breaker.

My biggest complaint was Toronto. The city just did not appeal to me at all. Rent prices were sky high in the city so I would have to live outside the city to have reasonable rent. At that point, I'm at the mercy of public transit, which is lacking in both reliability and value. At the time, I was living with my parents in Mississauga, which is approximately 30km west of Toronto. You might be thinking, 30km, so maybe 30 minutes commute? 30 minutes is incredibly optimistic. My commute would involve a 10 minute drive to the train station, 45 minute train ride to Toronto, and a 10 minute walk from the station to the office - which totals to an hour and 5 minutes one way. Public transit is unreliable in Toronto too, so my commute would range between an hour to an hour and a half one way. The train ride costed about $7 Canadian too, which I was paying out of pocket, so it becomes about $15 everyday, not including any costs from the car. For an average month with 20 work days, that ends up being $300 every month.

I also dislike the lunch options I had around the office too, which was also lacking in value. The people can also be not great, the climate can be very intense, and the lifestyle didn't quite suit me. With everything put together, I decided Toronto is not for me. I can only work in Canada legally without extra paperwork, but my only options for the cities were Vancouver, Montreal and Ottawa. However, all the cities have the same issues as Toronto, with the exception of Vancouver's climate. With that in mind, I knew that I would have to look outside of Canada to find the city for me. Since I was leaving Canada anyway, and given how much I enjoyed my trips to Japan, I figured I may as well try to apply for jobs in Japan first before considering other countries, so I applied for a few jobs in Japan in mid June 2019, and in August 2019 I signed a offer.

# The important paperwork

Since I don't have any connections with Japan, the first thing I needed was a work visa, and the entire process was guided by the company. For Japan, the process of getting a visa involves submitting an application for a Certificate of Eligibility (CoE). This certificate is created in Japan, and the certificate essentially states that the applicant meets all the requirements to receive a particular type of visa. In my case, my visa was the Engineer/Specialist in Humanities visa. Basically, the only requirement was to either have a **Bachelor's degree** in a field related to the job, or **10 years of related work experience**. I graduated with a Bachelor's of Applied Science, Computer Engineering, from the University of Waterloo, which satisfies the former requirement. I sent a copy of my degree, a filled out questionnaire, a copy of my passport photo ID page and a proper ID photo to the relocation company on September 3rd. The application for the CoE was submitted on September 12th and the relocation company received the physical CoE on September 30th. They sent me a scanned copy and sent the physical copy by courier, which I received on October 2nd.

With the CoE in hand, I had all that I needed to submit an application for the visa. I had to submit the application to the Consulate of Japan for my region, which happened to be in Toronto, about a 10 minute walk from my office. Speaking of the visa application, there was some information, such as "Initial Residence" that I did not know at the time of application, but I wrote "TBD" for those fields and the Consulate accepted my application. I submitted the application form, the CoE and my passport to the Consulate on October 3rd and the Consulate gave me a pickup receipt for October 10th and told me that if they do not call me before October 10th, there are no issues. There was no issues and on October 10th I returned to the consulate and received my passport with the visa inside. By the way, they actually _take_ your passport during the process - I did not have my passport between October 3rd and October 10th. I actually had a car trip to the US during this time, but since I had a NEXUS card, I did not need my passport to cross the border. Keep this in mind if you plan to go overseas around the same time. With visa in hand, my initial residence was prepared and my flight was scheduled for October 23rd, to arrive in Japan on October 24th.

# What about my belongings?

Of course, since I'm moving to a new country for work, I needed to ship my belongings. This was covered by Kuroneko Yamato, which is a large Japanese delivery company. The whole process happened during the time I was getting my visa.

I was initially contacted by Yamato on September 5th. They wanted to confirm my current address and schedule a time for them to come to my house to get an estimate. This was scheduled for September 11th. When they came to my house, I didn't prepare anything

# Initial settling in Japan

Oct 24(木)
Arrived in Japan. Had some difficulty looking for the Yamato counter at the airport (Haneda), because I was actually supposed to take it to a JAL ABC counter(I was looking explicitly for Yamato). ABC Counter also wanted me to use a Japanese phone number for contact, so I ended up using the Relo Japan contact's phone number. Found temporary residence without much issue. Also, had no yen in hand when arriving, but withdrew 5万円 using 7-11 ATM with my US bank card(Chase). I did set up a travel notification with Chase before arriving in Japan.

Oct 25(金)
大雨. Relo helped with going to city hall, then bank, then phone. Was done around 1pm because everywhere was less busy than usual(probably because of 大雨). Had to keep my Canadian phone number roaming so I could receive calls from Yamato just in case(the Yamato folks in Canada told me that they may use it contact me). Connected LINE with phone number(this becomes relavent later). Spent some time walking around Yodobashi / Nitori to get a rough idea of furniture and appliance prices. Also initiated a money transfer using Transferwise and xe, to transfer my USD/CAD -> JPY to my new bank account(totaling about 60万円). Note at this point, I did not actually have the bank card yet, so even if the money was in my account, I couldn't access it.

Oct 26(土)
Went apartment searching with apts.jp in the morning(had to get to the first place by myself, was taken around in a car to every other place). Decided on a 1st/2nd choice apartment after - but went back to those apartments after looking at them with apts.jp to check the neighbourhoods(good that I did, helped me decide). Also with regards to the money transfers from the previous day, I messed up account details on xe, so I had to call them. They had no toll-free number that worked in Japan on both the JP SIM and the Canadian SIM, so I called them using Skype web.

Oct 27(日)
Vacation-like day.

Oct 28(月)
Vacation-like day.

Oct 29(火)
Vacation-like day, but a few events. Money from Transferwise arrived in bank account. 1st choice apartment started going through application process from someone else, so had to go with 2nd choice apartment. Yamato contacted me by email to confirm a delivery date, I asked for Oct 31 morning, and also provided my JP phone number(since I gave them my Canadian number while I was in Canada, and the Relo Japan agent's phone number at JAL ABC). Got LINE notifications for Yamato delivery, so I was able to stop using my Canadian SIM card at this point.

Oct 30(水)
Vacation-like day.

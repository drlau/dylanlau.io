Points was something always on the back of my mind. Maybe one day I'll get elite status, I keep telling myself. It was something that I always wanted to do, but I never found the time or money to do it. In 2019, I did 2.5 round trips from Toronto to Japan, and didn't even get enough points for Aeroplan silver / Star Alliance Silver, which is only halfway to Gold, where the good benefits are.

Starting in late 2019, I started working full time in Japan. It was an exciting move and I'm enjoying life here. During the end of December, I started looking into points again. I already had 2 long haul round trips planned for 2020 - one between Tokyo and Singapore, and another between Tokyo and Toronto, so I figured that 2020 may be a good year to try and get elite status. I was aiming for Star Alliance Gold again since Star Alliance is the most convenient for me, so that means I should focus on ANA. Since it's the end of the year, points are about to reset, so there was no point focusing on Aeroplan which I had, so I could give ANA Mileage Club a try.

With that in mind, the first task for me to do was find an ANA card with a good bonus. When I lived in Canada, I heard of the term "churning" before but did not know what I meant. Some quick research later and I found that it was the process of getting a credit card with a nice signing bonus, meet the requirements of the signing bonus, and then cancel the cards. So I had the right idea to start - find an ANA card since it would maximize the points I get since I would  likely book flights on ANA, as well as earn miles through my daily purchases. Unfortunately for me, credit card signing bonuses are few and far between in Japan, and the only good ones are Amex. Sure enough, Amex had some bonuses available. The card I targeted was the Amex ANA Gold. With 2000 miles given immediately, 10k miles for 100,000¥, 28k miles for 700,000¥ and 20k miles for 1,000,000¥, in total it was 70,000 miles for spending 1,000,000¥ in 3 months. 1,000,000¥ in 3 months may be a bit too much for me, so if I don't get that bonus, it's 50,000 miles for 700,000¥. That seems a bit reasonable, so I set my target, but I didn't pull the trigger on applying just yet.

Come January 6, 2020. I only had 1 Japanese credit card at the time, and I noticed that my bank account was not automatically debited. In Japan, credit cards are paid through automatic withdrawals from your bank account on the payment date. While convenient, this means that if something goes wrong with withdrawing, it's basically a guaranteed late fee. On December 27, 2019 (Friday), I received a mail from my credit card company asking to re-submit the automatic withdrawal form because I messed up something on it. I did that and sent the mail back the following week on December 31 (Tuesday). Given that many companies gave their employees that week off for New Year holiday, and mail takes about 2 days, it is likely that they did not receive the form in time. I realized this on January 6, which was the payment due date, but since it was still Jan 6, it's technically not a "missed" or "late" payment yet. Although the timing of the mail and holidays mean that I should not be penalized for this missed/late payment, and everyone I talked to said that my credit history will probably not get hit, I didn't want to risk anything so I decided to quickly check for any other sign up bonuses and apply for a card before the end of the day.

Upon doing a bit more research on ANA cards in general, I found a card that interested me - the ANA Super Flyers Card. This elusive card is a special type of credit card that is Japan only and has an incredible benefit - as long as you hold the card, you are granted ANA Super Flyers status, which _is basically the equivalent of ANA Platinum_. ANA Mileage Club has 3 tiers: Bronze, Platinum and Diamond, where Bronze is earned at 25k points, Platinum 50k and Diamond 100k. Bronze gives you Star Alliance Silver, while Platinum and Diamond give Star Alliance Gold. So a better meaning of the credit card is, **as long as you have the card (by paying the annual fee), you have Star Alliance Gold**. This is a concept completely unheard of to me. When I lived in Canada, I was close to giving up on getting Star Alliance Gold because of the time and money I'd have to invest, and it is only valid for 1 year. But here, as long as I hold this credit card, I can have Star Alliance Gold semi-permanently. So of course, I decided to get this card. There are 8 different Super Flyers Cards, but there was 1 key point I was missing to apply for this card. **In order to apply for this card, you must currently be an ANA Platinum or Diamond member**. So, this means I only need to get ANA Platinum _once_, and then I have Platinum semi-permanently. Since it is subject to a credit check, I decided I should pick a card that has a non-Super Flyers equivalent and could be converted once I reach ANA Platinum. The ANA Gold Amex was one of those cards, so I quickly applied for the ANA Gold Amex before my credit history potentially gets affected. To my surprise, I was approved immediately and the card came 3 days later.

With card in hand and goals in mind, I was ready. Meet the 700,000¥ or 1,000,000¥ in 3 months minimum spending requirement, and get ANA Platinum. For ANA, statuses are reached using a system called Premium Points (PP), which is similar to miles but not the same. PP could only be accumulated by flying, and Platinum requires 50k PP. So, this means I need to do a lot of flying. PP cannot be earned on award tickets - I have to pay for my flights. So this is perfect, I buy tickets with my new Amex to meet the minimum spend and the PP requirement, as well as get bonus miles for booking through ANA directly. I am not rich and don't have too many vacation days since I just started working in Japan, so I needed efficient routes. Since I am in Japan on a Visa, I don't want to raise eyebrows at customs for many re-entries in a short period of time, so I should stick with domestic routes, with 1 or 2 international routes at most.

PP is earned at a similar ratio to flying - the further distance and higher class ticket you purchase, the more PP you earn. So I had to find the right balance between long flights, premium tickets, scheduling and prices. Some Google searches in Japanese led to the term SFC修行, or SFC (Super Flyers Card) Training, which is the process of efficiently flying to meet the requirements for Super Flyers Card. The overwhelmingly popular route for this process is Haneda <-> Okinawa round trips. There are many HND <-> OKA flights daily, so much so it was possible to do 2 round trips in a day. I am based in Tokyo, so Haneda is convenient for me, and with that I started my planning.

There are 4 primary fare types to note. They are as follows:

| Name                   | Type            | PP earned per HND<->OKA flight | Cost (¥) | ¥ / PP |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ | -------- | ------ |
| (Super) Value          | Economy         | 1476                           | Varies   | Varies |
| Flex for cardholder    | Economy         | 2368                           | 41860    | 17.68  |
| (Super) Value Premium  | Premium Economy | 2860                           | Varies   | Varies |
| Premium for cardholder | Premium Economy | 3352                           | 55860    | 16.67  |

Value and Value Premium fares may have the "Super" prefix. When they have the Super prefix, it means that the tickets were booked at least 28 days in advance, are cheaper, and are more limited than the seats without the "Super" prefix. Furthermore, these are seasonal fares and are gone at the end of March. The cardholder fares are discounted regular fares that I have access to since I have the ANA Amex, and are used as a backup. I received my card on January 9th, so 28 days later is February 7, which is a Saturday - so I had to make a fast decision on my flights for that Saturday, which I absolutely will want to fly on if seats are available.

The other thing to keep in mind is the cost. The Value fares vary depending on day and time, whereas the cardholder fares are fixed. The cardholder fares are fixed value, so if the ¥ / PP cost is higher than 16.67, I should book the cardholder fare. This means I can easily calculate the break even point for the Value fares by multiplying the PP earned by 16.67.

| Ticket type           | PP earned per HND<->OKA flight | Max cost (¥) |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| (Super) Value         | 1476                           | 24605        |
| (Super) Value Premium | 2860                           | 47676        |

In general, tickets are not this expensive but during peak periods, such as flying to Okinawa on a Saturday where Monday is a holiday, it is possible for the tickets to exceed the price. If the prices exceed the max cost, it makes more sense to purchase the Premium for cardholder fare. One key restriction of the Premium for cardholder fare is that it must be booked in a pair, whether it is round trip or the same one way flight twice. What this means is that by utilizing this fare, I can travel during peak periods while also providing a ceiling for the ¥ / PP cost. The advantages should become clear soon.

So to quickly recap the process, the goals are:

- Reach 50,000 PP
- Book efficient flights using the (Super) Value (Premium) fares
- Spend enough to make spending 700,000¥ within 3 months easy

The restrictions / conditions are:

- Can only travel on weekends or holidays
- Subject to seat availability
- Feb 15 past 5pm and Feb 16 are no good
- Feb 29 - Mar 3 are no good

Ready? Let's get started.

Since it was January 9th, Feb 7th (Saturday) was the earliest day that still has Super Value fares, so I had to make my decision quickly. However, Feb 10th (Tuesday) is a holiday, so Saturday flights to Okinawa with the Super Value (Premium) exceeded the 16.67 ¥ / PP ratio. Similarly, flights on Tuesday back to Haneda with the Super Value (Premium) fare also exceeded the 16.67 ¥ / PP ratio. If you remember what I mentioned earlier about Premium Cardholder fares, they have to be booked in pairs. So, here's the first candidate for that fare: HND->OKA on Feb 7th in the morning, and OKA->HND to Feb 10th in the evening.

If I were to book those flights, I would have to stay in Okinawa during those 3 days. However, Feb 9(Monday) is not a holiday. So I would have to return back to get to work, or take a vacation day. This is SFC training though, so I have to be efficient. Since the typical person would try to maximize their long weekend, they would take Monday off and stay in Okinawa from Saturday to Tuesday. This means that flights from Okinawa to Tokyo on Feb 7, Tokyo to Okinawa on Feb 10, and flights in either direction on Feb 8 and 9 should be cheap, and there should be Super Value Premium availability for those flights as well. So, to maximize the PP I can get at good value in short time, I should book OKA->HND on Feb 7, HND->OKA on Feb 10 and a same day round trip on Feb 8.

Based on availability, I found the following fares:

TODO

To minimize the number of flights I had to take to reach the PP requirement, I prioritized Premium fares, but you'll see one fare above that is Economy. The price was only 4 digits, so that price was way too good to pass up. You can see from the ¥ / PP ratios that the Economy fare's ¥ / PP ratio is at a ridiculously low 6.44 ¥ / PP. Now, adding the Premium Cardholder fares to the above fares, we can see the overall schedule.

TODO

With about 2.5h-3h in Okinawa with each trip, this is a good schedule, so I went ahead and reserved and purchased that, and the immediate deadline for the Value fares is satisfied.

Now, I was also eager to try flying in Premium for the first time in my life, and since the Premium Cardholder fare is fixed, it doesn't matter when I book it, so I also went ahead and booked a flight for January 13th(Monday), which is a holiday.

Now, let's check in with the remaining PP after taking all those trips. With the currently planned trips, I would get 23464 PP, which means I am approximately halfway done with 4 round trips. So, let's continue with the second half.

Starting with Feb 15th, I had family arriving at 5PM so if I were to do a round trip on that day, I would have to return by 5PM. Upon checking flight availability, I found OKA -> HND flights with Super Value Premium fare availability and it returns at 15:20, which is sufficient. Unfortunately, there was no HND -> OKA flights available for that morning with Super Value Premium fare, so I would have to book the cardholder fare. Again, the cardholder fare must be booked in pairs, so I would have to find one more flight to book with the cardholder fare, so I need to find one more peak time. Fortunately, on the following week, Feb 24 (Monday) is a holiday, so Feb 24 OKA->HND and Feb 22 HND->OKA are ideal times to use the cardholder fare. Upon checking the seat availability, all usable OKA->HND flights on Feb 24 was completely booked even with cardholder fare, and economy is way too expensive to consider it worth the value, so Feb 24 is a no go. For Feb 23, to my surprise, OKA->HND flights were fully booked for the Super Value Premium fare. There was availability for cardholder fare, so now my consideration is between HND->OKA on Feb 22 or OKA->HND on Feb 23. My decision would come down to the availability of the corresponding Value Premium flight during that time - so either OKA->HND on Feb 22 or HND->OKA on Feb 23. Unsurprisingly, seat availability in that timeframe was plentiful, but HND->OKA on Feb 23 was slightly cheaper. Thus, I booked HND->OKA (Feb 15) and OKA->HND (Feb 23) with the cardholder fare, and OKA->HND (Feb 15) and HND->OKA(Feb 23) with Super Value Premium. This added another 2 round trips, so just 2 more to go.

I already planned a Singapore trip from Feb 29-Mar 3 so the dates between then are a no go. So this meant I had to look at March availability, which is where it gets troublesome. Between around the 3rd week of March and the first week of April, it is a school holiday, and since the Value fares end at the end of March, they really end when the school holidays begin, which is Mar 21 (Saturday). Actually, Mar 20 (Friday) is also a holiday. So I had Mar 7, 8, 14 and 15 available, and I had to pick 2 of those days to do a round trip. March is also the beginning of the regular season, so ticket prices went up a little bit. So, the dates I would pick are dependent on the seat availability. 

Before that though, a quick math check on the points I would earn. Given the current fares, I would reach a total PP of 47328. This means I need another 2672 points, which is 1 Economy round trip. The other option is to credit my Singapore trip. My Singapore trip is an S class ticket both ways, so putting that into the simulator returns a PP yield of 2484 one way, so 4968 round trip. If I were to add it to my current total, it would be 52296. The PP difference between Premium Economy and Economy is approximately 1500, so if I credited my Singapore trip, I could afford to downgrade one of my Premium Economy fares to Economy. Upon checking my schedule, I would be able to change OKA->HND (Feb 15) flight to Economy and the price would decrease from 40210 to 10510. Thus, with that in mind, I booked my remaining flights and have a schedule that looks like this:

# Introduction

Points was something always on the back of my mind. Maybe one day I'll get elite status, maybe one day I'll have enough points to redeem for a nice flight, I keep telling myself. It was something that I always wanted to do, but I never found the time or money to do it. In 2019, I did 2.5 round trips from Toronto to Japan, and didn't even get enough points for my loyalty program's special tiers for elite status.

Starting in late 2019, I started working full time in Japan. It was an exciting move and I'm enjoying life here. During the end of December, I started looking into points again. I already had 2 long haul round trips planned for 2020 - one between Tokyo and Singapore, and another between Tokyo and Toronto, so I figured that 2020 may be a good year to try and get elite status. I never even achieved Star Alliance Silver, but I set my goals for Star Alliance Gold since Star Alliance is the most convenient for me, but I needed to evaluate the feasibility first.

# What is Star Alliance?

Star Alliance is the world's first and largest airline alliance. An airline alliance is a group of airlines that work together to provide their flyers with efficient ways to reach their destination, while the airlines benefit by directing their customers to a partner airline in the same alliance. Benefits are also shared at alliance level to improve the experience for their customers.

# What is Star Alliance Silver / Gold?

Star Alliance Silver / Gold are special statuses that grant you many benefits when taking any airline in Star Alliance. Star Alliance Silver does not have many benefits, but Star Alliance Gold is where the benefits are plentiful. These benefits include, but are not limited to:

- Priority airport check-in
- Priority baggage handling
- Airport lounge access for you and a guest
- Priority boarding
- Extra baggage allowance
- Priority lane for airport security
- Priority reservations waitlist
- Priority airport standby

You can find the complete details on the [Star Alliance Website](https://www.staralliance.com/en/recognition).

In order to achieve Star Alliance Silver / Gold, you need to be a certain tier of an airline's frequent flyer program. Each airline is free to select what tiers in their frequent flyer program is associated with what Star Alliance tier. For example, with Air Canada and their frequent flyer program Aeroplan, there are 5 special tiers: Prestige 25K, Elite 35K, Elite 50K, Elite 75K and Super Elite 100K. Elite 35K grants Star Alliance Silver and Elite 50K, Elite 75K and Super Elite 100K grant Star Alliance Gold. You only have the Star Alliance status while you have the associated program's frequent flyer tier. In Aeroplan's case, when you reach a tier, you only have that tier for a year, and then you have to re-qualify. So, if you were to get Elite 50K, you'd have Star Alliance Gold for the year that you have Elite 50K status, and then you need to re-qualify for Elite 50K in order to have Star Alliance Gold again.

Star Alliance is the most convenient for me since Canada only has Air Canada as their airline, and Air Canada is part of Star Alliance. Japan has 2 large airlines - Japan Airlines and ANA. ANA is a member of Star Alliance, so they should be the airline that I focus on. Since it's the end of the year, points are about to reset, so there was no point focusing on Aeroplan which I had, so I could give ANA Mileage Club a try.

# How does the Star Alliance Status relate to Miles for booking award flights?

Each airline has their own term for units of value for their award flights, but I will refer to them as "miles". Miles for award tickets are related to points for earning Star Alliance Silver / Gold in the fact that points for Star Alliance Silver / Gold are proportionally earned with Miles. You earn both miles and points by flying, but you can earn miles through making purchases with an associated credit card, whereas points must be earned by flying. Each Airline has their own rules, but all of them follow this pattern. To earn Star Alliance status, you have to reach a threshold of points which can only be earned by flying, and generally a certain amount of that flying must be with the specific airline matching the frequent flyer program.

# Getting started with ANA Mileage Club

The first thing to look into was how to achieve Star Alliance Gold with ANA Mileage Club. For comparison, for Aeroplan, there was 3 main components to getting Star Alliance Gold, which are Altitute Qualifying Miles (AQM), Altitude Qualifying Segments (AQS) and Altitude Qualifying Dollars (AQD). AQM is the variable amount that depends on the distance of each flight, AQS is a fixed amount equal to the number of flights you take, and AQD is the base price of an Air Canada flight. To earn Star Alliance Gold, you need at least Elite 50K, which requires 6000 AQD, and either 50,000 AQM or 50 AQS. Aeroplan's currency to book award flights is "Miles", and this currency can be earned by flying proportional to the AQM value of that flight, but you can also earn Miles with associated Aeroplan credit cards. From the description of AQM, AQS and AQD, those can only be earned by flying, and you cannot earn them through credit card purchases.

ANA Mileage Club functions in a similar manner. ANA's currency to book award flights is also "Miles", which can also be earned through ANA associated credit cards and by flying. ANA's statuses are Bronze, Platinum and Diamond, and each one is earned upon reaching a Premium Point (PP) threshold at 30,000, 50,000 and 100,000 respectively. Furthermore, at least half of each requirement must be earned from flying ANA flights. Premium Points are earned at a rate proportional to the distance of each flight, and the ticket class. To reach Star Alliance Gold, I need to reach ANA Platinum, so my goal is 50,000 PP.

# Finding the right credit card for churning

Since I would be affiliating my points with ANA, to maximize the potential value I can get through this process, the first task for me to do was find an ANA branded credit card with a good initial spending bonus. When I lived in Canada, I heard of the term "churning" before but did not know what I meant. Some quick research later and I found that it was the process of getting a credit card with a nice bonus upon signing/reaching a minimum spend amount, meet the requirements of the bonus, and then cancel the cards before the annual fee. So I had the right idea to start - find an ANA card since it would maximize the points I get since I would book flights on ANA, as well as earn miles through my daily purchases. Unfortunately for me, credit card bonuses are few and far between in Japan, and the only good ones are Amex. Sure enough, Amex had some bonuses available. The card I targeted was the Amex ANA Gold. With 2000 miles given immediately, 10k miles for 100,000¥, 28k miles for 700,000¥ and 20k miles for 1,000,000¥, in total it was 60,000 miles for spending 1,000,000¥ in 3 months. You also get 10,000 miles once you use the card for 1,000,000¥ total, with no time restriction. 1,000,000¥ in 3 months may be a bit too much for me, so if I don't get that bonus, it's 40,000 miles for 700,000¥. That seems a bit reasonable, so I set my target, but I didn't pull the trigger on applying just yet.

Come January 6, 2020. I only had 1 Japanese credit card at the time, and I noticed that my bank account was not automatically debited. In Japan, credit cards are paid through automatic withdrawals from your bank account on the payment date. While convenient, this means that if something goes wrong with withdrawing, it's basically a guaranteed late fee. On December 27, 2019 (Friday), I received a mail from my credit card company asking to re-submit the automatic withdrawal form because I messed up something on it. I did that and sent the mail back the following week on December 31 (Tuesday). Given that many companies gave their employees that week off for New Year holiday, and mail takes about 2 days, it is likely that they did not receive the form in time. I realized this on January 6, which was the payment due date, but since it was still Jan 6, it's technically not a "missed" or "late" payment yet. Although the timing of the mail and holidays mean that I should not be penalized for this missed/late payment, and everyone I talked to said that my credit history will probably not get hit, I didn't want to risk anything so I decided to quickly check for any other sign up bonuses and apply for a card before the end of the day.

# ANA Super Flyers Card

Upon doing a bit more research on ANA cards in general, I found a card that interested me - the ANA Super Flyers Card. This elusive card is a special type of credit card that is Japan only and has an incredible benefit - as long as you hold the card, you are granted ANA Super Flyers status, which _is basically the equivalent of ANA Platinum, including the Star Alliance status._ Bronze gives you Star Alliance Silver, while Platinum and Diamond give Star Alliance Gold. So a better meaning of the credit card is, **as long as you have the card (by paying the annual fee), you have Star Alliance Gold**. This kind of benefit is completely unheard of to me, as well as the rest of the world. When I lived in Canada, I was close to giving up on getting Star Alliance Gold because of the time and money I'd have to invest, and it is only valid for 1 year. But here, as long as I hold this credit card, I can have Star Alliance Gold semi-permanently. So of course, I decided to get this card. There are 8 different Super Flyers Cards, but there was 1 key point I was missing to apply for this card. **In order to apply for this card, you must currently be an ANA Platinum or Diamond member**. So, this means I only need to get ANA Platinum _once_, and then I have Platinum semi-permanently. Since it is subject to a credit check, I decided I should pick a card that has a non-Super Flyers equivalent and could be converted once I reach ANA Platinum. The ANA Gold Amex was one of those cards, so I quickly applied for the ANA Gold Amex before my credit history potentially gets affected. To my surprise, I was approved immediately and the card came 3 days later.

# Deciding on flight route to efficiently earn PP

With card in hand and goals in mind, I was ready. Meet the 700,000¥ or 1,000,000¥ in 3 months minimum spending requirement, and get ANA Platinum by earning 50k PP, with 25k from ANA flights. So, this means I need to do a lot of flying. PP cannot be earned on award tickets - I have to pay for my flights. So this is perfect, I buy tickets with my new Amex to meet the minimum spend and the PP requirement, as well as get bonus miles for booking through ANA directly. I am not rich and don't have too many vacation days since I just started working in Japan, so I needed efficient routes. Since I am in Japan on a Visa, I don't want to raise eyebrows at customs for many re-entries in a short period of time, so I should stick with domestic routes, with 1 or 2 international routes at most.

PP is earned at a similar ratio to flying - the further distance and higher class ticket you purchase, the more PP you earn. So I had to find the right balance between long flights, premium tickets, scheduling and prices. Some Google searches in Japanese led to the term SFC修行, or SFC (Super Flyers Card) Training, which is the process of efficiently flying to meet the requirements for Super Flyers Card. The overwhelmingly popular route for this process is Haneda <-> Okinawa round trips. There are many HND <-> OKA flights daily, so much so it was possible to do 2 round trips in a day. I am based in Tokyo, so Haneda is convenient for me, and with that I started my planning.

There are 4 primary fare types to note. They are as follows:

| Name                   | Type            | PP earned per HND<->OKA flight | Cost (¥) | ¥ / PP |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ | -------- | ------ |
| (Super) Value          | Economy         | 1476                           | Varies   | Varies |
| Flex for cardholder    | Economy         | 2368                           | 41860    | 17.68  |
| (Super) Value Premium  | Premium Economy | 2860                           | Varies   | Varies |
| Premium for cardholder | Premium Economy | 3352                           | 55860    | 16.67  |

Value and Value Premium fares may have the "Super" prefix. When they have the Super prefix, it means that the tickets were booked at least 28 days in advance, are cheaper, and are more limited than the seats without the "Super" prefix. Furthermore, these are seasonal fares and are gone at the end of March. The cardholder fares are discounted regular fares that I have access to since I have the ANA Amex, and are used as a backup. I received my card on January 9th, so 28 days later is February 7, which is a Saturday - so I had to make a fast decision on my flights for that Saturday, which I absolutely will want to fly on if seats are available.

The other thing to keep in mind is the cost. The Value fares vary depending on day and time, whereas the cardholder fares are fixed. The cardholder fares are fixed value, so if the ¥ / PP cost is higher than 16.67, I should book the cardholder fare. This means I can easily calculate the break even point for the Value fares by multiplying the PP earned by 16.67.

| Ticket type           | PP earned per HND<->OKA flight | Max cost (¥) |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| (Super) Value         | 1476                           | 24605        |
| (Super) Value Premium | 2860                           | 47676        |

In general, tickets are not this expensive but during peak periods, such as flying to Okinawa on a Saturday where Monday is a holiday, it is possible for the tickets to exceed the price. If the prices exceed the max cost, it makes more sense to purchase the Premium for cardholder fare. One key restriction of the Premium for cardholder fare is that it must be booked in a pair, whether it is round trip or the same one way flight twice. What this means is that by utilizing this fare, I can travel during peak periods while also providing a ceiling for the ¥ / PP cost. The advantages should become clear soon.

So to quickly recap the process, the goals are:

- Reach 50,000 PP
- Book efficient flights using the (Super) Value (Premium) fares
- Spend enough to make spending 700,000¥ within 3 months easy

The restrictions / conditions are:

- Can only travel on weekends or holidays
- Subject to seat availability
- Feb 15 past 5pm and Feb 16 are no good
- Feb 29 - Mar 3 are no good

# Scheduling Flights

This section is incredibly verbose with regards to my decision process for scheduling flights. The explanation is very thorough with the comparison of price, schedule restrictions and flight availability. It will most likely not be interesting to you as a reader unless you are looking into doing the SFC training process yourself or are interested in optimization problems in general. If you do not belong in either of these groups, I recommend you skip this section. For everyone else, let's get started.

Since it was January 9th, Feb 7th (Saturday) was the earliest day that still has Super Value fares, so I had to make my decision quickly. However, Feb 10th (Tuesday) is a holiday, so Saturday flights to Okinawa with the Super Value (Premium) exceeded the 16.67 ¥ / PP ratio. Similarly, flights on Tuesday back to Haneda with the Super Value (Premium) fare also exceeded the 16.67 ¥ / PP ratio. If you remember what I mentioned earlier about Premium Cardholder fares, they have to be booked in pairs. So, here's the first candidate for that fare: HND->OKA on Feb 7th in the morning, and OKA->HND to Feb 10th in the evening.

If I were to book those flights, I would have to stay in Okinawa during those 3 days. However, Feb 9(Monday) is not a holiday. So I would have to return back to get to work, or take a vacation day. This is SFC training though, so I have to be efficient. Since the typical person would try to maximize their long weekend, they would take Monday off and stay in Okinawa from Saturday to Tuesday. This means that flights from Okinawa to Tokyo on Feb 7, Tokyo to Okinawa on Feb 10, and flights in either direction on Feb 8 and 9 should be cheap, and there should be Super Value Premium availability for those flights as well. So, to maximize the PP I can get at good value in short time, I should book OKA->HND on Feb 7, HND->OKA on Feb 10 and a same day round trip on Feb 8.

Based on availability, I found the following fares:

TODO

To minimize the number of flights I had to take to reach the PP requirement, I prioritized Premium fares, but you'll see one fare above that is Economy. The price was only 4 digits, so that price was way too good to pass up. You can see from the ¥ / PP ratios that the Economy fare's ¥ / PP ratio is at a ridiculously low 6.44 ¥ / PP. Now, adding the Premium Cardholder fares to the above fares, we can see the overall schedule.

TODO

With about 2.5h-3h in Okinawa with each trip, this is a good schedule, so I went ahead and reserved and purchased that, and the immediate deadline for the Value fares is satisfied.

Now, I was also eager to try flying in a class that is not Economy for the first time in my life, and since the Premium Cardholder fare is fixed, it doesn't matter when I book it, so I also went ahead and booked a flight for January 13th(Monday), which is a holiday.

Now, let's check in with the remaining PP after taking all those trips. With the currently planned trips, I would get 23464 PP, which means I am approximately halfway done with 4 round trips. So, let's continue with the second half.

Starting with Feb 15th, I had family arriving at 5PM so if I were to do a round trip on that day, I would have to return by 5PM. Upon checking flight availability, I found OKA -> HND flights with Super Value Premium fare availability and it returns at 15:20, which is sufficient. Unfortunately, there was no HND -> OKA flights available for that morning with Super Value Premium fare, so I would have to book the cardholder fare. Again, the cardholder fare must be booked in pairs, so I would have to find one more flight to book with the cardholder fare, so I need to find one more peak time. Fortunately, on the following week, Feb 24 (Monday) is a holiday, so Feb 24 OKA->HND and Feb 22 HND->OKA are ideal times to use the cardholder fare. Upon checking the seat availability, all usable OKA->HND flights on Feb 24 was completely booked even with cardholder fare, and economy is way too expensive to consider it worth the value, so Feb 24 is a no go. For Feb 23, to my surprise, OKA->HND flights were fully booked for the Super Value Premium fare. There was availability for cardholder fare, so now my consideration is between HND->OKA on Feb 22 or OKA->HND on Feb 23. My decision would come down to the availability of the corresponding Value Premium flight during that time - so either OKA->HND on Feb 22 or HND->OKA on Feb 23. Unsurprisingly, seat availability in that timeframe was plentiful, but HND->OKA on Feb 23 was slightly cheaper. Thus, I booked HND->OKA (Feb 15) and OKA->HND (Feb 23) with the cardholder fare, and OKA->HND (Feb 15) and HND->OKA(Feb 23) with Super Value Premium. This added another 2 round trips, so just 2 more to go.

I already planned a Singapore trip from Feb 29-Mar 3 so the dates between then are a no go. So this meant I had to look at March availability, which is where it gets troublesome. Between around the 3rd week of March and the first week of April, it is a school holiday, and since the Value fares end at the end of March, they really end when the school holidays begin, which is Mar 21 (Saturday). Actually, Mar 20 (Friday) is also a holiday. So I had Mar 7, 8, 14 and 15 available, and I had to pick 2 of those days to do a round trip. March is also the beginning of the regular season, so ticket prices went up a little bit. So, the dates I would pick are dependent on the seat availability. 

Before that though, a quick math check on the points I would earn. Given the current fares, I would reach a total PP of 47328. This means I need another 2672 points, which is 1 Economy round trip. The other option is to credit my Singapore trip. My Singapore trip is an S class ticket both ways, so putting that into the simulator returns a PP yield of 2484 one way, so 4968 round trip. If I were to add it to my current total, it would be 52296. The PP difference between Premium Economy and Economy is approximately 1500, so if I credited my Singapore trip, I could afford to downgrade one of my Premium Economy fares to Economy. Upon checking my schedule, I would be able to change OKA->HND (Feb 15) flight to Economy and the price would decrease from 40210 to 10510. Thus, with that in mind, I booked my remaining flights and have a schedule that looks like this:

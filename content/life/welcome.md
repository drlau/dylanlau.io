# Motivation

Welcome to my life blog. My name is Dylan Lau and I am a Canadian Software Engineer currently working in Japan. I graduated from the University of Waterloo in Canada, with a Computer Engineering degree in 2018.

Before living in Japan, I came here for vacation about 8 times. In mid 2019, I decided that I wanted to leave Canada, and since I was leaving Canada anyway, I figured that I'd give Japan a try. I love many things about Japan - the food, culture, lifestyle, infrastructure, etc. Before living in Japan, I studied Japanese for a bit more than a year, and upon arrival I'd rate my proficiency at between N5 and N4.

Now that I'm in Japan, I truly feel like I'm becoming an adult. I used to live with my parents back in Canada, and now I'm renting my own apartment, paying bills, trying to make friends in a country where I am not very proficient with the language. It's truly a different experience, but I'm glad I took the leap.

When I was in Canada, my hobby was playing games, and my primary game was Final Fantasy XIV. During high school and university, I had my fair share of MMOs. But ever since coming to Japan, my hobbies quickly changed and I find myself struggling to find the motivation to play games. In fact, I bought Pokemon Sword on release day, but it's still unplayed in the case in January.

Nowadays, I have a focus on self improvement. Organizing my life, finances and relationships. Self improvement used to be a secondary focus alongside playing games, but now it's my main focus. This shift of focus has been extremely sudden, and I'm glad that it happened. This blog will serve as a journal for suddenly becoming a real adult, and sharing my experiences and knowledge. For anyone who stumbles upon my blog, I hope you enjoy my adventures and maybe learn something new to help you too.

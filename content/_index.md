title: About me
---

Welcome to my corner that I call home.

I'm a Software Engineer, working mainly with building and maintaining development platforms with Kubernetes and Go. My interests include cloud computing, infrastructure, DevOps, SRE and developer productivity.

I have 2 separate blogs, one for Software Engineering only related things and another about everything else. One of my hobbies is optimizing finances, which heavily involves credit cards and travel hacking, so there will be a fair amount of that content in the life blog.

I enjoy writing and continously seek improvement through documenting my experiences.

I'm still doing finishing touches on my blog, so disregard any weird things that you find.

Actual about me and picture coming soon&trade;.

title: About me
---

Welcome to my corner of the internet that I call home.

I'm a Software Engineering Manager, primarily focused on Platform Engineering to build and maintain an internal developer platform with Kubernetes and Go. Currently, I lead a Developer Experience team, which focuses on the productivity side of Platform Engineering. I love empowering others to do their best work, which makes me happy to be on a team whose work focuses on that, as well as a manager.

I love traveling and tend to do it a lot and comfortably. I travel to go to new places, visit friends and family, and for food and drinks.

I enjoy writing and continously seek improvement through documenting my experiences.

I'm doing a bit of an overhaul on my blog, so disregard any weird things that you find.

Actual about me and picture coming soon&trade;.
